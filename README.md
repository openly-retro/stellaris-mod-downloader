## What is this

This script is a wrapper around SteamCMD and can be used to download Stellaris mods from the Steam Workshop, given a mod ID.

This tool is not meant to be used in ways that would violate the Steam Subscriber agreement or otherwise harm Steam online services.

## Who's it for

The intended audience for this resource is modders of the game Stellaris.

## Why did I make this
My goal in creating this tool is to have a way to be able to examine the works of other modders, specifically to be able to look at works that are no longer maintained and investigate how they're designed and the ideas contained therein, using a method that is cheaper in terms of resources than using the Steam Client front-end.

I am a modder who creates content for Stellaris and made this at my convenience.
